### A two-card hand of 21 (an ace plus a ten-value card) is called a "blackjack"

# The play goes as follows:

# If the dealer has blackjack and the player doesn't, the player automatically loses.
# If the player has blackjack and the dealer doesn't, the player automatically wins.
# If both the player and dealer have blackjack then it's a push.
# If neither side has blackjack, then each player plays out his hand, one at a time.
# When all the players have finished the dealer plays his hand.

# The player's options for playing his or her hand are:

# Hit: Take another card.
# Stand: Take no more cards.
